You are given two integers n and k.

You should create an array of n positive integers a1,a2,…,an such that the sum (a1+a2+⋯+an) is divisible by k and maximum element in a is minimum possible.

What is the minimum possible maximum element in a?

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤109; 1≤k≤109).

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible maximum element in array a such that the sum (a1+⋯+an) is divisible by k.
